# Blockchain Ledger

The goal of the project was to build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger allows partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

## Technologies

This project was developed with python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [StreamLit](https://streamlit.io) - Streamlit is an open source app framework in Python language. It helps us create web apps for data science and machine learning in a short time.
* [Data Classes](https://github.com/ericvsmith/dataclasses) - Data classes are one of the new features of Python 3.7. With data classes, you do not have to write boilerplate code to get proper initialization, representation, and comparisons for your objects.
* [Typing](https://pypi.org/project/typing/) - Typing defines a standard notation for Python function and variable type annotations. The notation can be used for documenting code in a concise, standard format, and it has been designed to also be used by static and runtime type checkers, static analyzers, IDEs and other tools.
* [DateTime](https://pypi.org/project/DateTime/) - This package provides a DateTime data type, as known from Zope.
https://streamlit.io
* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - Providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive.
* [hashlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html) - This module implements a common interface to many different secure hash and message digest algorithms. Included are the FIPS secure hash algorithms SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 (defined in FIPS 180-2) as well as RSA's MD5 algorithm (defined in internet RFC 1321).

Also, I used [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) code editing to develope it.
